ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* market_images/
* market_images/BDokuFriends_screenshot_2.png
* market_images/BDokuGamePost.png
* market_images/BDokuHouaseAd.png
* market_images/BDokuHouaseAd_Flat.png
* market_images/b-doku_friends_web.png
* market_images/bdokuFriendScreenshot_1.png
* market_images/bdokuFriends.png
* market_images/bdokuFriends_flat.png
* market_images/bdoku_friends_splash_screenshot.png
* market_images/featureGraphic_friends.png
* market_images/featureGraphic_friends_24.png
* market_images/promo_graphic_friends.png
* market_images/promo_graphic_friends_24.png
* market_images/splash_board.png
* market_images/splash_board_flat.png
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.2.1.jar => app/libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.2.1.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/com/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/.DS_Store
* src/com/ironbrand/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/ironbrand/.DS_Store
* src/com/ironbrand/bdoku/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/ironbrand/bdoku/.DS_Store
* src/com/ironbrand/model/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/com/ironbrand/model/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
